# FORMERLY-Math: Constrained Form Finding through Membrane Equilibrium Analysis in Mathematica

## Documentation

FORMERLY-Math code is commented in order to explain its functionality to the final user. 

## Software History

This suite is an example of codes developed to conduct the constrained form-finding of unilateral membranes that can be applied for the design of new shell structures or for the static assessment of masonry vaults in the frame of Limit Analysis.

The underlying results are reported in the following publications:

- C. Olivieri, S. Cocking, M. Angelillo, M. J. DeJong, Investigation of the response of a masonry arch railway bridge using membrane equilibrium analysis, 12th International Conference on Structural Analysis of Historical Constructions, SAHC 2021, Barcellona, Spain„ 2021.
