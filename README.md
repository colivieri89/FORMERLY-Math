# FORMERLY-Math: Constrained Form Finding through Membrane Equilibrium Analysis in Mathematica

## Documentation

STONEHENGE modules are commented in order to explain their functionality to the final user. Each routine in the code has a short description about its purpose, and a list of inputs and/or outputs.

## Software History

This suite is an example of codes developed to conduct the constrained form-finding of unilateral membranes that can be applied for the design of new shell structures or for the static assessment of masonry vaults in the frame of Limit Analysis.

The underlying results are reported in the following publications:
